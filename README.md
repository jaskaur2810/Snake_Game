# Snake_Game
🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built using Java and Swing. This project recreates the traditional snake game found on early mobile phones and serves as a beginner-level GUI-based Java game development exercise.

📌 Project Description

This project implements the snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food items. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall. The GUI is implemented using Java Swing, and the game logic is handled using basic Java concepts.

It is a fun and interactive way to understand how 2D games are structured and how graphics, animations, and event handling work in Java.

Each food increases the snake’s length and score

Collision detection with:

Snake’s own body (game over)

Wall boundaries (game over)


Score is displayed in real-time

Smooth gameplay with timer-based game loop
